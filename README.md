# Solving Gym with DDPG
## Overview
This repository showcases an adapted implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for solving various environments provided by OpenAI Gym.

## Introduction to OpenAI Gym
OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a diverse range of environments for the development and testing of reinforcement learning models.

## Environment Details
The environments used in this repository and their solutions are briefly described. For in-depth information on each environment, please refer to the official OpenAI Gym website.

## Requirements
The solutions provided in this repository can be run on a standard CPU, with completion times ranging from a few minutes to tens of seconds. We used gym version 0.26.2.

## Our Solutions
Here are a few examples of our solutions to the various environments provided by OpenAI Gym:
